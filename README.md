An attempt at porting Baldi's Basics V1.4.3 into Godot 4.3 Created by Dem Apples

NO NEW FEATURES/QOL IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE MADE TO THIS PROJECT! 
(Example: Baldi's head appearing in the corner whenever you make a noise) 
A future fork of the project to add these changes may be created in the future to add these extra features. Whether that is done by me or by someone else is something I'm unsure of.

Porting job is based off of and aided by the Porky Powers' Baldi Decomp, which is based off of Jumpman25's Decomp. Therefore, it follows the same guidelines and restrictions they do

The license as listed on https://porkypowers.itch.io/baldi-open-source-classic-party is as follows:

Open Source Baldi License.
